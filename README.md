# AED_Final_Project (Vaccine Management System)

## Introduction: 
* The United States was devastated by a global epidemic caused by the coronavirus in March of 2020. 
Quarantines, mask regulations, product shortages, business closures, and firms rushing to find new ways to stay open were all consequences of the coronavirus epidemic.
* One of the most effective strategies to combat the pandemic is to create a comprehensive vaccination distribution system that affects everyone in the chain of life.
* The first barrier between these life-saving vaccines and the general population is the intricacies of the supply chain, which range from manufacturing to shipping to storage.
* Although significant, these supply chain challenges, according to viral epidemiologist and Director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, Dr. Saad B. Omer, are all surmountable.
* The broader issue is that supply chain constraints make it hard to vaccinate everyone all at once. As a result, we must make smart and equitable decisions about who should be vaccinated first.

## Enterprise Description:

To create an impartial and efficient vaccine distribution system we have created the below user journey:
1. Patient Enterprise : Firstly there two ways to get medical products : person visiting the doctor in the hospital to get vaccination and person ordering vaccine to be delivered at home.
2. Hospital Enterprise : Post the requirement both doctor and patient ( at home ) , the hospital would cumulate all the requirements and send a bulk request to the nearest Government body.
3. FDA Enterprise : Once the Government receives the request it validates and forwards the request to Pharmaceutical companies. 
4. Manufacturer Enterprise : These requested are accepted and delivered via Air Transportation or Road Transportation to both doctor at hospital and person ordering at home.

## Goal:
 - This application at its core enable public in remote areas to order vaccine at the comfort of their home when cannot travel to hospital and also helps log and manage all the vaccination requests at all tier of supply chain i.e hospitals, Government entity and Pharmaceutical companies.
